You have full control over what is sent and when. But once you set the marketing activity, we will do all the work for you and send messages to the right customer at the right time, automatically.

 = I am not a marketing expert. How can I know how to write a message or when to send it? =

With Remarkety you don’t have to be an expert. We recommend the best timing, the best wording, the best templates based on best practices from thousands of online stores just like yours.


 = How would I get Remarkety’s recommendations? = 

There are two ways to get the recommendation:

Simply follow Remarkety recommendation on the main dashboard.
Once a week you will receive an email from us with a recommendation that was generated for your store.

 = What types of emails will you send to my customers? =

We analyze your online store’s products, sales, and customers’ purchase history. Based on this analysis we recommend a variety of marketing activities, such as: Personal product recommendations, cart abandonment recovery, personal coupons, wake up call to inactive customers, order follow-up emails, feedback request and more.


 = Will my customers open these emails? = 

You bet! Researches shows, and our internal statistics confirms it, that stores that took advantage of automation and personalization improved conversions by up to 50%.


 = I want to make sure that the emails looks fine before sending them to my customers. What are my options? = 

Remarkety offers three ways to control your emails:

1. After setting the email text, click on "Preview" to see how the email will look like with real data from your store.
1. From the email editing page you can send a test email to a different email address to see how the various email clients will render it.
1. Start your activity in test mode. All emails will be sent normally, only they will be sent to your email address and not your customers' email address.


 = How will Remarkety help me comply with regulation?  = 

Remarkety will not allow you to run a marketing activity if the email text does not contain an {unsubscribe} tag. In addition, Remarkety will never send an email to a customer who asked not to receive emails from your store.



 = How can I be sure that I'm not bugging my customers with too many emails?  = 

Remarkety carefully monitors the amount of emails that your customers receive from you. So if a customer has received an email in the past number of days we will not send another email unless it is extremely “important”.
